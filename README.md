# retroshooter inital prompt
### "Please help me create a retro-style vertical scrolling shooter game inspired by River Raid from the 1980s. I'd like you to provide:

Core gameplay features:

A player-controlled aircraft flying up a scrolling river/terrain
Limited fuel that can be replenished by collecting items
Various enemy units to avoid or shoot down (boats, helicopters, etc.)
Bridges or obstacles that divide sections of the map
Increasing difficulty as the player progresses
Simple collision mechanics where hitting terrain or enemies ends the game

Implementation using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas with:

A component-based, modular architecture for easier maintenance and expansion
Efficient object pooling for bullets and enemies to improve performance
A simple asset management system for sprites and sounds
State management (menu, playing, game over states)
UI elements showing score, fuel level, and lives
Responsive design that scales to different screen sizes
Sprite sheet handling for animations

Additional features:

Local storage for saving high scores
Sound effects and background music implementation
Optimized collision detection for smooth gameplay

Development guidance:

Well-commented code explaining key concepts and implementations
A suggested development roadmap breaking the project into manageable phases
Extensibility points for adding new features later

Please structure the code in a way that makes it easy to understand and modify, with separate concerns for game logic, rendering, input handling, and state management."
